Covid DRUG-RESEARCH Paper model on Neo4j:

Based on Covid Research paper data shared on kaggle.com, this script will build DRUG referred in Research paper model on neo4j. 
This is two node relationship  (DRUG -[REFERRED_IN count:]-> PAPER) model.  The script parses through Medical research paper folder
(json files) and using spacy NLP module and med7 (EIR model for drugs).  

This script heavily inspired by work done by many people at Kaggle.

Before you run the script:
 - prepare neo4j env (I preferred neo4j container)
 # docker pull neo4j
 
 run neo4j
 # docker run -d --publish=7474:7474 --publish=7687:7687 neo4j
 
 - prepare python env

# Jupyter Pyspark notebook
The easiest way is to build with Jupyter PySpark notebook

#docker pull jupyter/pyspark-notebook



# On Notebook terminal
# pip install spacy

# Install med7 library
